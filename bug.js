This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo. The error message is not very helpful and usually looks something like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.setItem')`.  It happens intermittently and seems related to timing or race conditions when interacting with AsyncStorage in a component that mounts and unmounts frequently. The root cause is often the `AsyncStorage` not being properly initialized before the component tries to use it.
